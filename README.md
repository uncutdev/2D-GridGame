# 2D-GridGame

2D-GridGame is a simple interactive game developed using the Windows API and GDI. Players can navigate through a grid-based map where obstacles and walls are represented by specific integer values in a 2D array. For instance, `2` denotes walls, while `1` represents the player's position. This setup allows for easy customization of the game environment. I don't plan on working on this any further and will just keep this as a reference for projects in the future.

## Features
- **Grid-Based Movement:** Move freely across a grid of cells.
- **Collision Detection:** The game detects collisions with walls and obstacles, leading to game-over conditions.
- **Dynamic Map:** The game map is easily customizable by modifying the underlying 2D array values.
- **Windows Application:** Utilizes GDI for rendering graphics within a windowed environment.
